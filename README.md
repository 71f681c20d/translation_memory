# Translation Memory: A Game for Language Learning

This is my self-made tool for learning foreign languages rapidly and for rapid memorization.

## About the Game
- The game is very simple, and is based on the classic game of Memory.
- The game allows you to upload a CSV file containing text in 2 languages, or you can select one of the presets already bundled in the app
- You will then be shown the foreign language text and prompted to provide the translated text
- If you get the translation wrong, the phrase will be shuffled back into the deck and the next phrase will be displayed
- If you get it right, the phrase will be discarded.
- The random shuffling of the words/phrases promotes long-term memory so you don't forget.

### Usage
- This game is useful for expanding your vocabulary in a foreign language
- It also can be used to learn the writing system of foreign languages
- The game supports keyboard input, but it also allows you to bypass the keyboard input so that you can practice writing by hand on paper
- A good game would consist of 15-20 words/phrases. If you play for 3 rounds, you will usually have all the words memorized.
